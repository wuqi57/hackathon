HSL was designed back in the 70s to be computationally cheap. It is a clever geometric transformation of the RGB color space and it does not take into account the complexities of human color vision.\n\nThere have long existed color spaces designed for perceptual uniformity. One of these color spaces is [CIELUV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV) (and its cylindrically shaped brother CIE LCh<sub>uv</sub>. Like HSL, it defines hue and lightness, but instead of saturation it defines chroma. The problem with its chroma component is that it doesn't fit into a specific range. This makes it very hard to define colors programmatically. **HUSL is a modified version of the CIE LCh<sub>uv</sub> color space with a new saturation component**.\n\n[Demo, documentation etc.](http://boronine.com/husl)\n\n# Versioning\n\nThis repo contains the canonical implementation of HUSL, its source code being HUSL's informal specification. Following [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), the major version must be incremented whenever the color math changes. These changes can be tested for with snapshot files.\n\n# Testing and Building Documentation\n\nRun `npm install` and `npm test`. Try `cake snapshot` to generate a JSON file of the entire gamut to be used for debugging and regression tests. The format of the file is as follows:\n\n    {\n      \"#000000\": {\n        rgb: [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n        xyz: [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n        luv: [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n        lch: [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n        husl: [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n        huslp: [ 0, 0, 0 ]\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n\nBuilding documentation requires some libraries to be installed. If you are running [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), a wise way to do it would be to run `cake docker:build` followed by `cake docker:run`. You will find yourself inside a Docker container with everything set up to run `cake build:docs`.\n\n# Ports\n\nWith the help of Robert McGinley, HUSL was also [ported to Python](https://github.com/boronine/pyhusl) (version 2 only).\n\nA work-in-progress of C and Java ports is included in the repo, done by Lajos Ambrus. The Java port has some tests, added by [@Pimm](https://github.com/Pimm), but they are currently made to work with the Android SDK. It would be nice if someone made them more generic.\n\nA [Ruby port](https://github.com/soulcutter/husler) has been started by [@soulcutter](https://github.com/soulcutter). I would love to see this done so that HUSL could be integrated into [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).\n\n# License\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 Alexei Boronine\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
